the variable "var" is either 5 or not 5, this determines whether the KML output is "clampToGround" or "absolute", this seems to be the "ignore height" option in GUI

if the variable "unitsVariable" is 1 then units are m/s, otherwise mph. I don't think this matters during the actual calculations.

the checkVars are for differentiating which of the three vectors to write in.

BE SURE TO INCLUDE CODE THAT CHECKS TO MAKE SURE UPLOADED FILE IS EITHER A .XLS OR .TXT

Primary function parameters:
    openFilePath
    saveFilePath
    massInput(in kilos)
    var (calculates with altitude if var is 5, doesn't otherwise)
    checkVar (1 to calc velocity vector)
    checkVar2 (1 to calc Coordinates file)
    checkVar3 (1 to calc acceleration vector)
    unitsVariable (1 for m/s)
    checkVar4 (1 to calc force vector)
    fileVar(1 for .txt, 3 for .xls)


check out this KML/KMZ middleware on djangosnippets
How does one reference custom middleware??????
going to need to zip before download in case they want coords file
